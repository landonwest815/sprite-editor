# Required External Libraries
In order to utilize the sprite editor two external libraries will be needed. In
order to install them open up the 'Qt Maintenance Tool' and you will need to
add components. Specifically, you will need to install Qt 6.6.0 'Qt Speech' and also
Qt 6.6.0 'Qt Multimedia' which will allow the text-to-speech functionality of the sprite
editor to function properly.
